Import wait_random from the previous python file that youâ€™ve written and
write an async routine wait_n that takes in 2 int arguments: n and max_delay.
You will spawn wait_random n times with the specified max_delay.

wait_n should return the list of all the delays (float values).
List of delays should be ascending order without using sort() cause of
concurrency.
